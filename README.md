# odin-recipes

Right now i have vague ideas about how i will create my first project here on TOP.

I dont know where to get the recipes, images, or the text to be put into the website. It might just be too early to comment because is still havent read all the details in the lesson right now.

Update1:
I've read up to Iteration 3 and all of my previous questions have been answered. I only have one recipe right now so ill be updating it in a moment.
